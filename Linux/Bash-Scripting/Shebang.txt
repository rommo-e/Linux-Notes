The shebang line is always at the top of each script and always starts 
with "#!". This line containts the path to specified interpreter.(/bin/bash) 
with which the script is executed. We can also use Shebang to define other intpertreters like Python, Pearl, and others. 


For example for using Python 

python:
	#!/usr/bin/env python 
perl:
	#!usr/bin/env perl
