Many of the above commands may be automatically run with a script to go through 
the report and look for any weaknesses. 
We can run many scripts to automatically enumerate the server by running common commands that return any intersting findings.
Some of the common Linux enumeration scripts include 
¬Libenum 
¬linux privchecker

And for Windows
¬Seatbelt 
¬JAWS

Another useful tool we may use for server enumeration is the 
Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts SUITE (PEASS)
at it is well maintained to remain up to date and includes scripts for enumerating
both Linux and Windows

IMPORTANT
These scripts will run many commands known for identifying vulnerabilities and create 
a lot of "noise" that may trigger anti-virus software or security that looks for these types of events. 
This may prevent scripts from running or even trigger an alarm that the system has been compromised.
In some cases , we may want to do a manual enumeration instead of running scripts.
