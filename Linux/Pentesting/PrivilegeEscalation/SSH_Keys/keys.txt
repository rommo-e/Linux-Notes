	If we have read access over the .ssh directory for a specific user, we may read their private ssh keys found in 


	/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa or /root/.ssh/id_rsa 
	And use it to log in in to the server. 
	If we can read the /root/.ssh/ directory and can read the id_rsa file, we can copy it to our machine and use the -i flag to 
	log in with it.

	$vim id_rsa
	$chmod 600 id_rsa 
	$ssh user@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa
