Whenever we encounter a server running on an old operating system, we should start by looking for potential kernel vulnerabilities that may exist. 
Suppose the server is not being maintained with the lates updates and patches. In that case ,it is likely vulnerable to specific kernel exploit found on 
unpatched versions of Linux and Windows. 

For example after running a script like linpeas.sh

$sh linpeas.sh
We can encounter with vulnerabilities like the CVE-2016-5195 it is also known as Dirty Cow , another alternative is to use Merasploit for a specific 
Linux Vulnerability. 
With a simple scan we can know 3.9.0-73-generic

The same concept applies to Windows ,as there are many vulnerabilities in unpatched/older versions of Windows, with various vulnerabilities that can be 
used for privilege escalation. 


VULNERABLE SOFTWARE 
Another thing we should look for is installed software. For example, we can use the dpkg -l command on linux or look at C:\Program Files in Windows to see
what software is installed on the system. We should look for public exploits for any installed software , especially if any older versions are in use, containing unpatched vulnerabilities
