Once we gain initial access to a box, we want to thoroughly enumerate the box to
find any potential vulnerabilities we can exploit to achieve a higher privilege level. We can find many checklists and cheat sheets online that have a collection of checks we can run and the commands to run these checks.

One excellent resource is HackTricks, which has an excellent checklist for both Linux and Windows
local privilege escalation.
Another excellent repository is PayloadsAllTheThings, which also has checklists for both Linux and Windows. We must start experimenting with various commands and techniques and get familiar with them to understant multiple 
weaknesses that can lead to escalating our privileges.
