In both Linux and Windows, there are methods to have scripts run at specific intervals to carry out a task.
Some examples are having an antivurus running every hour or a backup that runs every 30 minutes. There are usually ways to take 
advantage of scheduled tasks (Windows) or cron jobs (Linux) to escalate our privileges:

 
-Add new scheduled task/cron jobs 
-Trick them to execute a malicious software

The easiest way to check if we are allowed to add new scheduled tasks.
In Linux a common for of maintaining scheduled tasks is through Cron Jobs. There are specific directories that we may be able to utilize to add a new cron job
if we have the write permissions over them. 
These include : 

1./etc/crontab 
2./etc/cron.d
3./var/spool/cron/crontabs/root

If we can write to a directory called by a cron job, we can write a bash script with a reverse shell command, which should send us 
a reverse shell executed.
