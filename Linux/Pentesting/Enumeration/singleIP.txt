Before we can scan a single host for open ports and its services, we first have to determine if its alive or not
for this , we can use the common method for nmap 

$sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host 

If we disable port scan (-sn), Nmap automatically ping scan with ICMP Echo Requests(-PE)
Once such a request is sent, we usually expect an ICMP reply if the pinging host is alive.
The more intersting fact is that our previous scans did not that because before NMAP could send an ICMP echo requests, it would send an ARP ping resulting in an ARP reply.

We can confirm this with the --packet trace option. To ensure that ICMP echo requests are sent we also define the option (-PE) for this.
