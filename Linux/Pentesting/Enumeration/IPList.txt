During an internal penetration test, it is not uncommon for us to be provided with an IP list
with the hosts we need to test. Nmap also give us the option of working with list and reading the hosts from list instead of manually defining or typing them in. 
Such a list could look something like this. 

$cat hosts.lst 

If we use the same scanning technique on the predefined list , the command look like this

$sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
