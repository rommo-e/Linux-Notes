It can also happen that we only need to scan a small part of a network. An Alternative to the method we used last time is to specify multiple IP adresses.
This can be done using the command
$sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20 | greo for | cut -d" " -f5

To simplify this expression if the IP adresses are next to each other, we can also define the range in the respective octet 

$sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18-20|grep for | cut -d" " -f5
