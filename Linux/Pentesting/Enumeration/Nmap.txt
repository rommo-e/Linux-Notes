Network mapper is an open-source network analysis and security 
auditing tool written in C, C++, Python and Lua. 
It is designed to scan networks and identify which hosts are available on the network using raw packets, and services and applications, including the name and version. 

It can also identify the operating systems and versions of these hosts. 


Nmao also offers scanning capabilities that can determine if packet filters, firewalls or intrusion systems.

USE CASES 

-Audit the security aspects of networks 

-Simulate penetration tests

-Check firewall and IDS settings and configurations

-Types of possible connections 

-Network mapping

-Response analysis

-Identify open ports 

-Vulnerability assessment as well 

There are many options Nmap provides to determine wether our target is alive or not.
--The most effective host discovery method is to use ICMP echo requests 

It is always recommended to store every single scan. This can be used for comparison , documentation, and reporting.
