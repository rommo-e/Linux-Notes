Enumeration is the most critical part of all. The art 
the difficulty, and the goal are not to gain access to our target computer
Instead it is identifyung all of the ways we could attack a target we must find. 

The tools are just tools we should never replace with our knowledge and our attention to detail.

Enumeration is colleting as much information as possible. 

Most of the ways we can get access we can narrow down to the following two points: 


 °Functions and/or resources that allow us to interact with the target and/or provide additional information

 °Information that provides us with even more important information to access our target.

Most of the information we get comes from misconfigurations or neglect of security for the respective 
services. 
Misconfigurations are either the result of ignorance or a wrong security mindset.

ENUMERATION IS THE KEY

It's not the tools we haven't tried, but rather the fact that we don't know how to interact 
with the service and what's relevant.
