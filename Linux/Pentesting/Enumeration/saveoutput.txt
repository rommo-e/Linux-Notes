It is always important to save the output obtained from every nmap scan this for terms of 
examination and evaluation since depending on the status of the network the scans may change. 
Here are the three principal formats in which is possible to save the output from our nmap. 

~Normal output (-oN) with the .nmap file extension 
~Grepable output (-oG) with the .gmap extension 
~XML output (-oX) with the .xml extension 

or we can also specify for the -oA command for saving in all three formats the output from the 
scanning. 

For saving all the possible outputs the command in the terminal woul look like this 

`<bash>
$sudo nmap {IP} -p- -oA target 
`
where -oA is for saving all the ouput and -p- for scanning all the ports

the default setting for storage the output is the current directory if no other path is 
specified 


Every output has it advantage the one from the XML format is that we can easiy input it into a 
HTML file since reports in this format are easy to read even for non-technical people. 

The way for doing this is to convert the XML file into an HTML with the tool -xsltproc-

`<bash>
$xsltproc target.xml -o target.html 
`
