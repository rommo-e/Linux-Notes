Once we compromise a system and exploit a vulnerability t execute commands on the compromised hosts remotely, we usually need a method 
of communicating with the system not to have to keep exploiting the same vulnerability 
to execute each command.

To enumerate the system or take further control over it or within its network, we need a reliable connection that gives us a direct access to the system's shell, i.e., Bash or Powershell, so we can thoroughly investigate the remote system for our next move. 

One way to connect to a compromised system is through network protocols, like SSH or WinRM , but , unless we obtain a set of login credentials, we would not be able to utilzie these methods without executinh commands on the remote system first.

The other method of accessing a compromised host for control  and remote code execution is through shells. 

There are three main types of shells , each of these shells has a different method of communication with us for accepting and executing our commands
-Reverse Shell : Connects back to our system and gives us control through a reverse connection

-Bind Shell: Waits for us to connect to it and gives us control once we do

-Web Shell:Communicates through web server,accepts our commands through HTTP parameters, executes them, and prints back the output.
