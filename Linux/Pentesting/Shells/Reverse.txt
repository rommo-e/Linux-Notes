A Reverse Shell is the most common type of shell, as it is the quickest and easiest method to obtain control over a compromised host.
Once we identify a vulnerability on the remote host that allows remote code execution , we can start a netcat listener on our computer
that listens on a specific port , say port 1234.

With this listener in place, we can execute a reverse shell command that connects the remote systems shells, i.e., Bash or PowerShell to out netcat
