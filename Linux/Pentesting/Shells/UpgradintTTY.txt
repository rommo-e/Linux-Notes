Once we connect to a shell through Netcat, we will notice that we can only type commands or backspace, but we cannot move the 
text cursor left or right to edit our commands, nor can we go up and down to access the command history. 
To be able to do that, we will need to upgrade our TTY. This can be achieved by mappng our terminal TTY with the remote TTY.

There are multiple methods to do this. For our purposes, we will use the python/stty method. In our netcat shell we will use the following command to use python to upgrade the type of our shell to a full TTY-

$python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

After we run this command , we sill hit ctrl+z to background our shell and get back on our local terminal, and input the following stty command: 

$^Z 
$stty raw -echo 
$fg 

[Enter]
[Enter] 

Once we hit fg, it will bring back our netcat shell to the foreground. At this point, the terminal will show a blank line. We can hit enter again to get back to our shell or input reset and hit enter 
to bring it back. At this point we would have a fully working TTY shell with command history and everything else. 

We may notice that our shell does not cover the entire terminal. To fix this 
we need to figur out a few variables
We can open another terminal window on our system, maximize the windows or use any size we want, and then input the following commands to get our variables.

$echo $TERM
$stty size 

The firs command showed us the TERM variable, and the second shows us the values for rows and columns. Respectively.
Now that we have our variables, we can go back to our netcat and use the following command to correct them: 

$export TERM=xterm-256color
$stty rows 67 columns 318

Once we do this we have a netcat shell that uses the terminal's full features, just like SSH connection
