The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an excellent tool for pentesters
It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use these exploits again vulnerable targets.

MSF has many other features like: 

-Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets

-Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerabilty without actually compromising the target. 

-Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and run commands on compromised targets

-Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools. 

TO RUN METASPLOIT use

	$msfconsole 

Once we have Metasploit running, we can search for our target application 
with the <<search exploit>> command 


For installing metasploit run the command 

	<<sudo apt install exploitdb -y >>

Tip: Search can apply complex filters such as search cve:2009 type:exploit. See all the filters with help search
Then we can search for the exploit founded using OSINT for example for Windows SMB vulerabilities one well know is eternalblue so the command would be 

$search exploit eternalblue

Then if we want to use the exploit we call the exec file founded 

$use /exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec 2017-03-14

But it won't be a successful exploit since the payload is not configured
o fix this misconfiguration we can set the option needed

for this case only the RHOSTS option is required to be set using the IP address

$ set RHOSTS {IP}

Not every Metasploit Framework supports the --check-- function.

Finally we can use the $run or $exploit command to execute the exploit.

After this if we use the command --whoami-- we can see that we have been able to gain admin access to the box
