The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an excellent tool for pentesters
It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use these exploits again vulnerable targets.

MSF has many other features like: 

-Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets

-Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerabilty without actually compromising the target. 

-Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and run commands on compromised targets

-Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools. 

TO RUN METASPLOIT use

	$msfconsole 

Once we have Metasploit running, we can search for our target application 
with the <<search exploit>> command 


For installing metasploit run the command 

	<<sudo apt install exploitdb -y >>
