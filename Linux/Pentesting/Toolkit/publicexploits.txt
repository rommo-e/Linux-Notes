Once we have identify the services running on ports identified from Nmap scan
the first step is to look if any of the applications/services have any public exploits.

Public exploits can be found for web applications and other applications running on open ports, like SSH or ftp.

After installing searchsploit a very useful tool for searching vulnerabilites from within the terminal
using the command 
$sudo apt install exploitdb -y
Remember that the -y option is for confirming the installing

Then we can use searchsploit to search for a specific application by its name as follows
$searchsploit openssh 7.2

We can also utilize online exploit databases to search for vulnerabilities
Here are some of the more widely used databases
°ExploitDB
°Rapid7 DB
°Vulnerability Lab
