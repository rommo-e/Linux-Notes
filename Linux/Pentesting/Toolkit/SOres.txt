When attacking from a blackbox we can follow a tutorial, 
a blog or a exploratory video explaining the steps. 

It is always good to mix between the two learning styles
so that we build our skills with the proper 
structure of knowledge and challenge ourserlves to 
deepen our understanding of the skills we learned.

Here are listed some resources 
VULNERABLE MACHINES/APPLICATIONS
There are many resources available to practice common web and 
network vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled setting. 

The following are some examples of purposefully vulnerable
web applications and vulnerable machines that we can 
set up in a lab enviroment for extra practice. 

¬OWASP Juice Shop : Is a modern vulnerable web application 
		    written in Node.js, Express, and Angular
	 	    which showcase the entire OWASP Top Ten 
		    along with many other real-world applocation 
		    security flaws. 

¬Metaspoitable 2  : Is a purposefully vulnerable Ubuntu Linux 
		    VM that can be used to practice enumeration 
		    automated and manual exploitation

¬Metaspoitable 3  : Vulnerable Windows VM with a wide of 
		    vulnerabilities. 


¬DVWA 	 	  : This is a vulnerable PHP/MySQL web application 
		    showcasing many common web application 
		    vulnerabilities with varying degrees of difficulty

It is worth learning how to set these up in your lab enviroment 
to gain extra practice setting up VMs and working with common 
configurations such as setting up a web server.
