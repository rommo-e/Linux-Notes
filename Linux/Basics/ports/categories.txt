There are two categories of ports. 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and 
User Datagram protocol. 

TCP is connection-oriented, meaning that a connection 
between a client and a server must be established before data can be sent.
The server must be in a listening state awaiting connection request from clients. 


UDP utilizes a connectionless communication model. 
There is no "Handshake" and therefore introduces a 
certain amount of unreliability since there is 
no guarantee of data delivery. 

UDP is useful when error connection/checking is 
either not needed or is handled by the application it self.
