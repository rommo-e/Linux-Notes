systemctl can be used to list all external services that are installed by 
the user, which usually include all services. Such services run in the
background without any user interaction.
These are also called daemons and are identified by the letter d.


To list all the serices using systemctl we can use
	
	systemctl list-units --type=service

In other cases it is possible that the services do not start due to an 
error. To see these problems we can use the next tool with journalctl

	journalctl -u ssh.service --no-pager
