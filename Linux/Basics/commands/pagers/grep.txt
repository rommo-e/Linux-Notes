	There are many different pagers first we have for example the [more] pager
	which shows all the logs and information about the file and the content 
	remains in the terminal. Similar to more is less it will show everything 
	but at the moment of quitting the page the content will not remain in 	
	the terminal. Other commands that work similar are [tail] & [head] that as 
	their names say show the first then lines and the last ten lines.

	More examples include the case when we want to [sort] by alphabet or by 
	number. 

	More often, we will only search for specific results that contain patterns 
	we have defined. 
	One of the most used tools for this is grep, which offers many 
	different features. 
	Accordingly, we can search for users who have the default shell 
	"/bin/bash" set as an example.

		$ cat /etc/passwd | grep "/bin/bash"
