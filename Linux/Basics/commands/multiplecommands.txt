There are three posibilities to run several commands, one after the other.
These are separated by : 

	°Semicolon (;)
	°Double ampersand characters (&&)
	°Pipes (|)
The differences between them lies in the previous processes 
treatment and depends on whether the previous process was completed
succesfully or with errors. The semicolon (;) is a command separator
and executes the commands by ignoring previous commands results and errors.
