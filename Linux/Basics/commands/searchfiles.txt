	For searching files we have three different 
	options.

	The first one is which -> this is very useful
	when we need to find the location of a program
	for example for Python would be 

	$which python 
	or for curl 
	$which curl 

	The next option is find, find list all the 
	results that satisfy the conditions 
	for example for finding all the images 
	would be something like 

	$ find / -type f -name *.JPG

	or a more complex task like finding all the 
	configuration files made by the root user 

	$ find / -type f -name *.conf -user root -size +20k -newermt 2020-03-03 -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null 

	IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE 

	2>/dev/null is a STDERR redirection to the 
	´null device´.This redirection ensures that
	no errors are displayed on the terminal.
	This redirection must not be an option to the 
	´find´ command
