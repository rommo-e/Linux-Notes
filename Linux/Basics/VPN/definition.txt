	A virtual private Network allows us to connect to a private (internal) network and 
	access hosts and resources as if we were directly connected to the target private network
	It is a secured communications channel over shared public networks to connect
	to a private network. 

	When connected to a VPN, data originates from the VPN server rather than our computer
	and will appear to originate from a public IP address other than our own.

	There are two main types of remote access VPNs : client-based VPN and SSL VPN.

	SSL VPN uses the web browser as the VPN client.
