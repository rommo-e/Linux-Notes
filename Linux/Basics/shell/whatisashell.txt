The shell is a program that takes input from the user
via the keyboard and passes these commands to the operative
system to perform a specific function. 

Bash is an enganced version of sh. 

The expression "getting a shell" reffers to exploit the 
target host , and that an access to the shell level is gained. 

A shell may be obtaining by exploitung a web app 
or networl/service vulnerability or obtaining credentials and 
logging to the target host remotely. 
There are three main types of shell connections.

°Reverse shell : Initiates a connection back to a listener 

°Bind shell: "Binds" to a specific port of the target host and waits for a connection from the 
attack box. 

°Web shell: Runs OS commands via the browser.
Not interactive or semi-interactive. (i,e., leveraging a file upload 
vulnerability and uploading a PHP script to 
run a single command.
