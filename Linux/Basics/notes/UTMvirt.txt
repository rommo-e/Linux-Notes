	For creating virtualization in a Macbook Pro with M1 chip 
	UTM is a great option , install from the app store and then download
	the live version of the linux version , next thing is to try to 
	install a barebones Parrot OS version.

	After selecting all the CPU cores RAM memory and storage dedicated to
	it shut down the machine and delete the USB drive to let know the machine
	where to boot from.

	After that install tasksel using 
	
	$ sudo apt install tasksel 

	and then try 

	$ sudo tasksel install ubuntu-desktop 
		
		if this doesn't work then 

	$ sudo tasksel install ubuntu desktop  %without the hyphen
