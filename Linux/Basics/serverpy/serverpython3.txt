For starting a server in a selected port , usually the port 8080 is the 
chosen one we have to run the command 

$sudo python3 -m http.server 8080 

Important: when finishing using this server for file transfer or other 
function always kill the process. 
In this case for killing the process we would need to run another command 

$pkil -9 -f 'python3 -m http.server 8080'

look out for errors in the chapsticks or quotes in case this doesn't work, 
also this will allow to run the server in another moment without conflict
